could you maybe help us (Jiali and me) with some back trajectory calculations similar like the ones you did for George for the following **local times**?
## local times
- 20.5. 3-6 am

- 15.5. 6-7 am

- 19.2. 7-9 am

- 28.3. 8-10 pm

## info 
- Typically the time windows of free tropospheric air influence are between 4-6 hours long, 
  - the times above are roughly centered in these slots with typically about an hour or more before and after,
  - where we still expect similar conditions to apply, 
    - so that the model might be more accurate. 
- We expect these air masses to have a rather large free tropospheric influence, 
- but we are also interested, if, within the studied area, the air masses are 
  - reaching ground at some point and
  - how long the air parcels roughly travel trough 
    - boundary layer / free tropospheric air, if that would be possible.
    



## P.S.

There are also some interesting features in some boundary layer cases, we would like to understand:

16.5.  9am - 6 pm (hourly, because a lot is happening that day)

19.5. 1-2 pm

But these are (for now) not as important as the four times in the beginning, so please, look into those only, if this is super easy for you and doesn't require a lot of time.

Some more interesting cases, that might be worth a closer look, but they might be more difficult, because the free tropospheric air mass influence seems to not last long during these times are 

  - 11.5. ~8:30 am and 
  - 18.5. ~7 am, 
    
but the model might not be able to resolve these times, I think, because the FT influence here is only about 1 or 2 hours long, so don't worry about these. Except you want to test the "time-resolution" of your model statistics, then it could make sense...
